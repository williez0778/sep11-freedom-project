The tools I have looked at and decided between of which I wanted is those below.
[Aframe](https://aframe.io/)
[Machine learning](https://ml5js.org/)
[Babylonjs](https://www.babylonjs.com/)
### Knowledge:
The tool that I seem to have picked at the moment will be Aframe and what I plan on making is maybe a system that allows the user to move as he pleases but I don't know how difficult it is to do.
### Where I am at
I am just exploring Aframe and looking at all the games and stuff they have for example on their site I haven't build anything yet.
### Skills
The skills being used really are How to google since I used it to find examples of what Aframe can do and see the basic codes that is done in the back and Organization because I had to organize what I had to search since I was going to look at what option first what options are out there etc.
