### Knowledge
The knowledge I learned this year I am not sure what will directly apply to this project since I still haven't really figure out how to bring javascript into Aframe since I have been trying to learn the basics of Aframe first and adding javascript to Aframe seemed a bit confusing though I haven't really tried yet so ya.
### Skills
The skills being used during this time was How to google and How to read since Aframe has articles and a decent amount of text you can read and to sort of guide you which if you don't read your losing out on information and the How to google comes in since you want to learn on what you are actually doing and what you can do since copying from a project is pointless.
### Where I am at
Where I am at this project is just tinkering around trying to learn the basics seeing what commands are there looking at the codes of the examples for the next step I want to be able to be able to understand the codes and how they actually work anyone can copy and paste and change the basics but that's not the point but in general I would say maybe in the brainstorming step.
### Sources
I have watched videos on some Aframe for example this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTFPMxqod2I) or I have refered to site such as [this site](https://aframe.io/aframe-school/#/9)
